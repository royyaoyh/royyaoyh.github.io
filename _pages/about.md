<!-- About Me
====== -->
Hello, My name is Roy Yao. I am an undergraduate student currently studying Bioengineering and EECS at UC Berkeley. My interests lies in imaging and devices. I have multiple experiences in signal processing, software, and hardware. 

I am currently part of [Conolly Lab](https://bisl.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) under [Professor Steven Conolly](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sconolly.html) where I work on implementing a low noise preamp for Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). Besides research, I am also involved with [Bioengineering Honor Society (BioEHS)](https://bioehs.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) and [Neurotech@Berkeley](https://neurotech.studentorg.berkeley.edu/).

In my free time, I love reading about history and am currently trying to pick up sketching again!

Projects
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
