Hello, my name is Roy Yao. I am an undergraduate student currently studying Bioengineering and EECS at UC Berkeley. My interests lie in imaging and devices. I have experience in signal processing, software, and hardware.

I am currently part of [Conolly Lab](https://bisl.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) under [Professor Steven Conolly](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sconolly.html) where I work on implementing a low noise preamp for Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). Besides research, I am also involved with [Bioengineering Honor Society (BioEHS)](https://bioehs.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) and [Neurotech@Berkeley](https://neurotech.studentorg.berkeley.edu/).

In my free time, I love reading about history and am currently trying to pick up sketching again!

Projects
------
**[EMG-Based Word Detection Sensor](files/bioe101.pdf)**
- Designed and prototyped a facial EMG sensor using Ag/AgCl electrodes, AD620 instrumentation amplifiers, and Arduino MKR Zero ADC for real-time speech-related signal acquisition. 
- Implemented two-stage band-pass filtering (20–500 Hz, gain ≈ 4000) and autocorrelation-based classification augmented with cosine similarity, MSE, and CNN algorithms, achieving 99% word detection accuracy. 

**[Computational Modeling of Lung Mucosal Immunity](files/bioe104.pdf)**
- Built a COMSOL Multiphysics 2D axisymmetric model of the bronchiole to simulate mucosal and humoral clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis under oscillatory airflow. 
- Integrated diffusion, laminar flow, and antibody-antigen neutralization kinetics to study bacterial clearance across mucus, periciliary, and epithelial layers.
