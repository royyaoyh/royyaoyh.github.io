My experience studying abroad in Taiwan during 2025 Summer!
<!--more-->
During summer of 2025, I participated in the 2025 Summer Research Program at National Tsing Hua University and conducted research under [Professor Chih-Chen Chen](https://pme.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/406-1308-74024,r4027.php?Lang=en). Over the weekends, I travelled with other friends to multiple destinations such as, Taipei, Keelung, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Sun Moon Lake. I am excited to visit Taiwan again in the future!
